# hello-world

Entering a totally different world.Abrupt switch from world of physics(it will always have a special place in my heart) to the world of CS.
Am scared, totally devastated don't have words to describe my state, but if I'm not wrong,
life follows the rule of "survival of the fittest". I belive in it. I'm going to survive.I am up for the challenge. 
Let's do it.
